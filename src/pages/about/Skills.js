        <p>Each skills has it's own seperate page where you can learn more about my experience and what I have planned for the future!</p>
        <p>I hope to expand this list as much as possible over the next few years!</p>

        <h1>Personal Skills</h1>
        <p>I enjoy working in a team and have been told I do a good job of communicating my ideas with others.</p>
        <p>I love to learn new things, and am always pushing myself to improve and learn from others.</p>
        <p>During the final year project for my degree I took on a lot of the leadership roles for my team. I actually ended up being team leader for the second half of the project!</p>
        <p>I consider myself very punctual and take pride in showing up on time.</p>
